                <p>After reading our short blurb based on the fact that we don’t take commission from retailers for effectively ‘marketing their products for them’, you might be thinking “How does WSY stay live without receiving commission?” There is two main ways we earn our money: Advertising and Recommendation. We also have small cash flows from sponsorships etc.</p>

              <div class="paragraph">
                <h2 class="title is-size-4">Advertising</h2>
                  <p>Advertising is the method of posting advertisements for other products on your website or video etc. As much as we hate delaying you, to keep the service free we must have ads on our site. This is why you see ads at the bottom of our page and after you finish a quiz. We refrain from using full page ads, and opted for the box or strip ads you see sometimes. <br> <br>Since we appreciate our well-designed site, we work only with advertisers that can provide is with a nice looking advertisements. We know all too well how a site can be destroyed by terrible looking ads, so we work directly with businesses or with reputable advertisers. <br> <br>We hope our advertisements don’t cause you too much hassle and  in the future we hope to develop a way to get rid of them for good.
</p>
                <h2 class="title is-size-4">Recommendation</h2>
                  <p>On some links, we use a services like the ‘Amazon referral program’ to generate a small amount of income based on a CPC or Cost Per Click basis. Note however, that this does not mean that we prioritise sites like this. We give you links based on their value, not on the amount of profit we make from them. <br> <br>You may find sometimes that links that are not the cheapest are at the top of the list. There are many reasons this could happen and is usually associated with flash sales. Please take into account that this is out of our control, but if you contact us we can get the issue sorted right away. We will never prioritise links based on how much income we receive from them, and will never offer priority link slots on our product pages.
<br> <br>Thank you for reading this short piece about the running of our site, and we hope to see you with the products we’ve selected you on our social feeds. <br><br>Conor Curley.
