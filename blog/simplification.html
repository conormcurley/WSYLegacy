              <h2 class="title is-size-4">Introduction</h2>
                <p>In most of our quizzes we follow a tight path to make them as understandable as possible. We use a technique that allows us to simplify information, but still offer an adequate description. The technique is as follows: title simplification, description shortening and addition shorthand details.</p>
            </div>
              <div class="paragraph">
                <h2 class="title is-size-4">Title Simplification</h2>
                  <p>We will generally find a word of the same meaning that is more widely known. For example if the component is a Hard Disk Drive or a Solid State Drive, we will simplify it to storage. This allows for a concise heading to inform the reader what they are being asked right away.</p>
                <h2 class="title is-size-4">Shorthand details</h2>
                  <p>We try our best to shorten the details to a few characters for ease of reading. For example if we are offering a 120GB SSD, the only storage details you are given is that the SSD is 120GB in size. This may seem vague, but the final product description will offer a more complex analysis. An in-depth description is simply unnecessary here.</p>

                <h2 class="title is-size-4">Description Shortening</h2>
                  <p>We try to summarise the description of the product to only a few words. This allows the reader to read all of the questions in the shortest amount of time. For example if an example is ten lines long in our documents, we will shorten it about a line and a half for our quizzes.
                <br> <br>Thank you for reading this short piece about the running of our site, and we hope to see you with the products weâ€™ve selected you on our social feeds. <br><br>Conor Curley.
