                  <h1>Introduction - What is WSYCode?</h1>
                  <h2>What is it?</h2>
                  <p>It's common knowledge that some people are sceptical about ordering goods online. It's also common knowledge that you want to sell as much as you can. <br><br>
                    This is what WSYCode is for: moving sales from the internet into the real world. This is how it works:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Each of your products has a generated product code stored in your own personal WSYCode Database.</li>
                      <li>When a customer sees a product they like online, they click the "Get Code" button on your site.</li>
                      <li>The customer then recieves the product code by text, email or app notification.</li>
                      <li>The customer presents this product code in the form of a QR code to one of your sales representitives, that sales rep scans the code with their smartphone throught the WSYCode app and can bring the user to that product straight away.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So you might be thinking now "What is the point of this?". There are many reasons, here are a few:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Saving time</strong> - Many products from the same manufacturer have similar names. Take the Apple MacBook Line up for example. The MacBook Pro is commonly referred to by consumers as just "the MacBook". This is where a problem arises because Apple also makes a product called "MacBook". <br><br>In this situation, the sales rep takes the customer to the wrong computer because the customer didn't have the right name. If the customer was to use WSYCode, the sales reps would know exactly what computer they need right away, saving the customers time and also decreasing the amount of time it took to make the sale. </li>
                      <li><strong>Happier Customers</strong> - Customers like to be in and out of a store quickly. Using WSYCode allows your sales representitives find the right product quicker, thus increasing the probability that they will return. </li>
                      <li><strong>More effective work from sales representitives</strong> - Since less time is spent finding the right product for customers who already know what they want, sales reps can focus more on customers that need help finding the right product in the first place.</li>
                    </ul>
                  <h2>Who is it geared towards?</h2>
                  <p>This service is geared towards business with both physical and online stores (e.g. PCWorld, Next etc). We also think the service is only beneficial if your business has a large product stock. A business that satisfies both of these requirements is able to use WSYCode. </p>
                  <h2>Should I use it?</h2>
                  <p>To avoid unnecessary costs, use the following checklist to make sure this service will work for you. Recommedations are what we would like you to have if you would like to use WSYCode, and requirements are requisites that must be met in order to be considered for an account.</p>
